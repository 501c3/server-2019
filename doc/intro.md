#Introduction
The Georgia DanceSport Registration project is building an 
open source system for classifying competitors and determine 
their eligibility for various events in DanceSport. Georgia
DanceSport is currently analyzing the various classifications 
used by various competitions running under the auspices of 
NDCA and USA Dance as well as exam requirements of ISTD.

Georgia DanceSport currently sponsors a yearly 
competition in September.  The competition is used
for consumer testing of the registration process under
development.
